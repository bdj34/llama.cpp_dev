You are provided with excerpts of a patient's medical notes. Your task is to identify when the patient had colonoscopies.

### Instructions:
1. Extract the month and year of all colonoscopies that are documented in the patient's notes. Ensure that the patient actually underwent this procedure.
2. Indicate whether the colonoscopy was done at the VA (internal) or externally (e.g. private practice).
4. Ignore other procedures or ambiguous references.
5. If there is no documentation of colonoscopy, answer 'No documented colonoscopy'.

### Format your response as follows:
Colonoscopy month: {Month}. Year: {YYYY}. Site: {Internal/VA or External}.
Colonoscopy #2: ...

Fill out a new line for each unique colonoscopy documented in the notes.

Here is an example response:
Colonoscopy month: October. Year: 2019. Site: VA.
Colonoscopy month: February. Year: 2021. Site: External.
Colonoscopy month: January. Year: 2022. Site: VA.

### Important points:
- Do not assume information that is not stated in the notes.
- Do not assume that a patient had a colonoscopy just because they were scheduled for one.
- The same colonoscopy may be referenced in multiple notes, but each colonoscopy should be recorded only once.
- If you are not sure about the site, feel free to answer 'Unknown'.<|eot_id|>
