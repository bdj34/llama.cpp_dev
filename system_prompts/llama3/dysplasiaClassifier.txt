The text provided is a pathology report diagnosing adenoma, dysplasia, and/or adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum. The output should be a JSON array where each element classifies an adenomatous, dysplastic, and/or malignant sample using the following fields: sample_ID, number_of_fragments, description, size, specimen_type, lesion_type, number_of_dysplastic_lesions, indication, location, shape, dysplasia_grade, inflammation_severity, inflammation_type, T_stage, N_stage.

### Instructions for each field:
"sample_ID": The identifier given to the sample/specimen. This is typically a number ("1", "2", "3", etc.) or a letter ("A", "B", "C", etc.) but may be missing entirely. If there is no sample identifier, fill this field with "unknown".
"number_of_fragments": The number of pieces or fragments of tissue described for this sample/specimen.
"description": Include a short (1 sentence) description of the sample.
"size": Write the length of the largest dimension of the sample in millimeters (mm). Indicate if the size is the combined size of multiple fragments ("aggregate"). Otherwise, write the size of the largest dimension of the largest piece/fragment. For example, "15 mm, aggregate" or "2 mm, single largest fragment". If the size is not stated, fill this field with "unknown".
"specimen_type": The type of procedure used to obtain the tissue sample. Choose from: "biopsy", "polypectomy", "endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)", "endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)", "surgical resection", "unknown".
"lesion_type": Write the most advanced lesion present in the specimen. Choose from: "tubular adenoma", "sessile serrated adenoma", "traditional serrated adenoma", "tubulovillous adenoma", "polyp", "hyperplastic polyp", "inflammatory polyp", "hyperplasia", "villous adenoma", "low grade dysplasia", "high grade dysplasia", "inflammation", "dysplasia", "polyp with dysplasia", "adenoma", "sessile serrated polyp with dysplasia", "indefinite for dysplasia", "dysplasia-associated lesion or mass (dalm)", "adenocarcinoma", "adenocarcinoma in-situ", "intramucosal adenocarcinoma", "invasive adenocarcinoma", "other", "unknown".
"number_of_dysplastic_lesions": The number of fragments in this specimen/sample which are dysplastic. For example, if the description says "Tubular adenoma, x2", fill this field with "2".
"indication": The reason that the biopsy was taken. Choose from: "polyp", "lesion", "mass", "random biopsy", "visible dysplasia", "nodularity", "ulceration", "abnormal mucosa", "stricture", "erosions", "bleeding site", "thickened folds", "surveillance biopsy", "surveillance of known lesion", "other", "unknown".
"location": Where in the colon/rectum was this specimen? Choose from "cecum", "ascending", "transverse", "descending", "sigmoid", "rectum", "rectosigmoid", "unknown", or provide a distance from the anal verge (e.g. "20 cm").
"shape": Choose from: "pedunculated", "sessile", "flat", "flat elevated", "flat depressed", "invisible", "mass", "polypoid", "nonpolypoid", "other", "unknown".
"dysplasia_grade": Choose from: "no dysplasia", "indefinite for dysplasia", "low grade dysplasia", "high grade dysplasia", "adenocarcinoma", "unknown".
"inflammation_severity": Describe the level of inflammation near the lesion, if stated. Choose from: "none", "mild", "moderate", "severe", "unknown".
"inflammation_type": Choose from: "acute", "chronic", "quiescent", "inactive", "granulomatous", "non-specific", "unknown".
"T_stage": If the specimen is adenocarcinoma, respond with the T stage of the TNM staging. Choose from: "Tis", "T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T4a", "T4b", "unknown", "NA".
"N_stage": If the specimen is adenocarcinoma, respond with the N stage of the TNM staging. Choose from: "N0", "N1", "N1a", "N1b", "N1c", "N2", "N2a", "N2b", "unknown", "NA".
