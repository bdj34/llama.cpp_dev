The text provided is a pathology report diagnosing adenoma, dysplasia, and/or adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum. The output should be a JSON array where each element classifies an adenomatous, dysplastic, and/or malignant sample using the following fields: sample_ID, description, type, indication, location, size_mm, shape, dysplasia_grade, inflammation_severity, inflammation_type, multifocal, T_stage, N_stage.

### Instructions for each field:
"sample_ID": The identifier given to the sample/specimen. This is typically a number ("1", "2", "3", etc.) or a letter ("A", "B", "C", etc.) but may be missing entirely. If there is no sample identifier, fill this field with "unknown".
"description": Include a short (1 sentence) description of the sample.
"type": Write the most advanced lesion present in the specimen. Choose from the following list: "tubular adenoma", "sessile serrated adenoma", "traditional serrated adenoma", "tubulovillous adenoma", "polyp", "hyperplastic polyp", "inflammatory polyp", "hyperplasia", "villous adenoma", "low grade dysplasia", "high grade dysplasia", "inflammation", "dysplasia", "polyp with dysplasia", "adenoma", "sessile serrated polyp with dysplasia", "indefinite for dysplasia", "dysplasia-associated lesion or mass (dalm)", "adenocarcinoma", "adenocarcinoma in-situ", "intramucosal adenocarcinoma", "invasive adenocarcinoma", "other", or "unknown".
"indication": The reason that the biopsy was taken. Choose from: "polyp", "lesion", "mass", "random biopsy", "visible dyslasia", "nodularity", "ulceration", "abnormal mucosa", "stricture", "erosions", "bleeding site", "thickened folds", "surveillance biopsy", "other", or "unknown".
"location": Where in the colon/rectum was this specimen? Choose from "cecum", "ascending", "transverse", "descending", "sigmoid", "rectum", "unknown", or provide a distance from the anal verge (e.g. "20 cm").
"size_mm": Write the length of the largest dimension of the lesion in millimeters. For example, "15 mm". If the size is not stated, fill this field with "unknown".
"shape": Choose from: "pedunculated", "sessile", "flat", "flat elevated", "flat depressed", "invisible", "mass", "polypoid", "nonpolypoid", or "unknown".
"dysplasia_grade": Choose from: "no dysplasia", "indefinite for dysplasia", "low grade dysplasia", "high grade dysplasia", "adenocarcinoma", or "unknown".
"inflammation_severity": Describe the level of inflammation near the lesion, if stated. Choose from: "no inflammation", "mild", "moderate", "severe", or "unknown".
"inflammation_type": Choose from: "acute", "chronic", "quiescent", "inactive", "granulomatous", "non-specific", or "unknown".
"multifocal": Are multiple lesions described at once? Answer "yes" or "no". If yes, state the number of samples grouped together. For example, "yes, x2".
"T_stage": If the specimen is adenocarcinoma, respond with the T stage of the TNM staging. Choose from: "Tis", "T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T4a", "T4b", "unknown", or "NA".
"N_stage": If the specimen is adenocarcinoma, respond with the N stage of the TNM staging. Choose from: "N0", "N1", "N1a", "N1b", "N1c", "N2", "N2a", "N2b", "unknown", or "NA".
