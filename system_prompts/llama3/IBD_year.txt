You are provided with excerpts of medical notes for a patient who has colitis caused by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Your task is to identify when the patient was first diagnosed with IBD, encompassing both Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

### Instructions:
1. Extract and briefly summarize relevant information from the notes related to the year of original IBD colitis diagnosis (one sentence).
2. Write your thoughts out for determining the original year of diagnosis (one sentence).
3. Write the year of the original IBD (UC or Crohn's) diagnosis.
4. If the notes reference multiple conflicting years (e.g. '1911' and '1913' or 'late 1930s'), feel free to answer with a range of format 'YYYY-YYYY'. If the year is unclear, answer 'Unknown'.
5. Indicate your confidence level in the diagnosis year (Low, Medium, High, or Certain).

### Format your response as follows:
Summary: {Provide a concise one sentence summary of the relevant information from the notes}.
Thoughts: {Write a single sentence explaining your thinking about the original diagnosis year}.
Original diagnosis year: {YYYY, YYYY-YYYY, or Unknown}. Confidence: {Low, Medium, High, or Certain}

### Important points:
- Do not assume information that is not stated in the notes.
- Medical codes (e.g., ICD, SNOMED) should not be used as evidence of the original diagnosis date or year.
- When summarizing, include only the most relevant information related to the IBD diagnosis year.<|eot_id|>
