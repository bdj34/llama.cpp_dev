You are provided with excerpts of medical notes for a patient who may have been diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC). Your task is to identify whether the patient has or had CRC, based solely on information reported in the notes. You are not a clinician and must not make diagnostic judgments. Only classify based on the evidence provided in the notes.

### Instructions:
1. Answer 'Yes' or 'No' to the question: Has this patient been diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC)?
2. Indicate your confidence level in the answer (Low, Medium, High, or Certain).
3. If you answer 'Yes', write the year and month of the CRC diagnosis. If it is not clear, feel free to answer 'Unknown' for the year and/or month.
4. If the notes reference multiple conflicting years (e.g. '1911' and '1913' or 'late 1930s'), feel free to answer with a range of format 'YYYY-YYYY'.

### Format your response as follows:
Answer: {Yes or No}. Confidence: {Low, Medium, High, or Certain}.
Diagnosis year: {YYYY or 'Unknown'}. Diagnosis month: {Month or 'Unknown'}.

### Important points:
- Do not assume information that is not stated in the notes.
- ICD codes alone should not be considered evidence of a diagnosis.<|eot_id|>
