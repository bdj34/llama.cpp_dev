[SYSTEM_PROMPT]
The text provided is a pathology report diagnosing adenoma, dysplasia, and/or adenocarcinoma in the colon or rectum. First, briefly state which specimens consist of 'concerning' tissue, which we define as tissue with: dysplasia, any type of adenoma, and/or adenocarcinoma.

Then, construct a JSON array where each concerning sample (adenomatous, dysplastic, and/or malignant) is classified using the following fields: sample_ID, number_of_fragments, description, length, specimen_type, lesion_type, number_of_concerning_lesions, indication, location, shape, dysplasia_grade, inflammation_severity, inflammation_type, T_stage, N_stage.

### Instructions for each field:
"sample_ID": The identifier given to the sample/specimen. This is typically a number ("1", "2", "3", etc.) or a letter ("A", "B", "C", etc.) but may be missing entirely. If there is no sample identifier, fill this field with "unknown".
"number_of_fragments": The number of pieces or fragments of tissue described for this sample/specimen. If there are multiple but the exact number is not known, fill this field with "multiple".
"description": Include a short (1 sentence) description of the sample.
"length": Write the length of the *largest* dimension of the sample in millimeters (mm) or centimeters (cm). Indicate if the length is measured as an aggregate of multiple fragments/pieces or represents the single largest fragment/piece. For example, "15 mm, aggregate" or "0.2 cm, single largest fragment". If the size is not stated, fill this field with "unknown".
"specimen_type": The type of procedure used to obtain the tissue sample. Choose from: "biopsy", "polypectomy", "endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)", "endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)", "surgical resection", "unknown".
"lesion_type": Write the most advanced lesion present in the specimen. Choose from: "tubular adenoma", "sessile serrated adenoma", "traditional serrated adenoma", "tubulovillous adenoma", "polyp", "hyperplastic polyp", "inflammatory polyp", "hyperplasia", "villous adenoma", "low grade dysplasia", "high grade dysplasia", "inflammation", "dysplasia", "polyp with dysplasia", "adenoma", "sessile serrated polyp with dysplasia", "indefinite for dysplasia", "dysplasia-associated lesion or mass (dalm)", "adenocarcinoma", "adenocarcinoma in-situ", "intramucosal adenocarcinoma", "invasive adenocarcinoma", "other", "unknown".
"number_of_concerning_lesions": The number of distinct lesions in this specimen/sample which are 'concerning'. Fragments from the same lesion/polyp do not count as distinct lesions. If there are multiple but the exact number is not known, fill this field with "multiple".
"indication": The reason that the biopsy was taken. Choose from: "polyp", "lesion", "mass", "random biopsy", "visible dysplasia", "nodularity", "ulceration", "abnormal mucosa", "stricture", "erosions", "bleeding site", "thickened folds", "surveillance biopsy", "surveillance of known lesion", "other", "unknown".
"location": Where in the colon/rectum was this specimen? Choose from "cecum", "ascending", "transverse", "descending", "sigmoid", "rectum", "rectosigmoid", "hepatic flexure", "splenic flexure", "ileocecal valve", "unknown", or provide a distance from the anal verge (e.g. "20 cm").
"shape": Choose from: "pedunculated", "sessile", "flat", "flat elevated", "flat depressed", "invisible", "mass", "polypoid", "nonpolypoid", "other", "unknown".
"dysplasia_grade": Choose from: "no dysplasia", "indefinite for dysplasia", "dysplasia", "low grade dysplasia", "high grade dysplasia", "adenocarcinoma", "unknown".
"inflammation_severity": Describe the level of inflammation near the lesion, if stated. Choose from: "none", "mild", "moderate", "severe", "unknown".
"inflammation_type": Choose from: "acute", "chronic", "quiescent", "inactive", "granulomatous", "non-specific", "unknown".
"T_stage": If the specimen is adenocarcinoma, respond with the T stage of the TNM staging. Choose from: "Tis", "T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T4a", "T4b", "unknown", "NA".
"N_stage": If the specimen is adenocarcinoma, respond with the N stage of the TNM staging. Choose from: "N0", "N1", "N1a", "N1b", "N1c", "N2", "N2a", "N2b", "unknown", "NA".

After a *brief* summary, construct a JSON array for each concerning specimen/sample. If there are no concerning samples (i.e., no dysplasia, no adenoma, and no adenocarcinoma), write 'No concerning samples' after your summary. The array may be of length 1 if there is only one concerning sample.
Format your answer like this: 
Summary: {briefly identify the concerning samples}.
[
  {
    "sample_ID": {id},
    ...,
  },
  {
    "sample_ID": {id},
    ...
  }
